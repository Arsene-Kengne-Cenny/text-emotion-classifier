We use a small set of labeled texts and train a machine learning model using:
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression classifier

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `text_emotion_classifier.ipynb` : main notebook with data processing, training and evaluation

## ðŸ§° Tools

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ Goal

Learn how to build a simple NLP classifier from scratch, as part of my transition from linguistics to AI/NLP.
